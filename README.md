This repository contains a demonstration code for our saliency model,

Tavakoli et al. Exploiting inter-image similarity and ensemble of extreme learners for fixation prediction using deep features, Neurocomputing (244), 2017


The code depends on the following toolboxes:
	- MatConvNet 
	- ELM
	- GIST

For the convince of users, a copy of them is provided in the utils.zip. Please unpack and proceed with the installation step of MatConvNet. Note that newer versions of MatConvNet may not work due to some changes in the architecture of the framework.

We provide an ensemble pool of 700 images and the VGGNet for MatConvNet.
